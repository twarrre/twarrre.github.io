<img id="aboutimg" src="/assets/icons/about.png" width="154" height="192" />My name's Trevor Ware and I am living in Richmond, British Columbia. I love playing video games and enjoy making them.

Ever since I was little, I've wanted to make video games, so I went to BCIT to learn how to become a video game developer. Currently, I am working at <a href="http://blackbirdinteractive.com/">Blackbird Interactive</a> as a junior programmer. This site contains some of the games and software I have made over the years.

Feel free to email me from the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page if you have any questions or concerns.
