<img id="aboutimg" src="/assets/icons/about.png" width="154" height="192" />My name's Trevor Ware and I am living in Richmond, British Columbia. I love video games and enjoy making them.

Currently I am going to school at BCIT to become a video game developer. This site contains some of the games and software I have made throughout the years.
