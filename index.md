My name's Trevor Ware and I am currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I love video games and enjoy making them.

Currently I am going to school at BCIT to become a video game developer. This site contains some of the games and software I have made throughout the years. If you like what you see, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twarrre).
