<img id="aboutimg" src="/assets/icons/about.png" width="154" height="192" />My name's Trevor Ware and I am living in Richmond, British Columbia. I love playing video games and enjoy making them.

Ever since I was little, I've wanted to make video games, so I am attending BCIT to become a video game developer. In addition, I am working for BCIT to manage one of their computer labs. This site contains some of the games and software I have made over the years.
