<img id="aboutimg" src="/assets/icons/about.png" width="154" height="192" />My name is Trevor Ware and I live in Richmond, BC. I am an experienced video game programmer, who loves playing and making video games. 

I have over seven years of experience in the games industry. I started my career at <a href="http://blackbirdinteractive.com">Blackbird Interactive (BBI)</a> in 2016 as an Associate Programmer, and I'm now a Senior Programmer.

My most recent role at BBI was as an Associate Lead Programmer for an unannounced project developed in Unreal Engine 5, where I specialized in gameplay and character movement.

Before that, I worked on <a href="https://twarrre.github.io/games/2022/05/24/hardspace_shipbreaker/">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, developed in Unity. I started working on Shipbreaker in 2016 and it was released in 2022. I was a generalist programmer on Shipbreaker, and I worked on features including the grappling hook, the elemental system, procedural ship generation, ship save load and console porting.

I studied programming at the <a href="http://www.bcit.ca">British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)</a>, and graduated in 2016, where I received my Bachelors of Technology specializing in VIdeo Game Development.
