It's come back from the dead!

Yes, it has been a while since I last posted. In January, school took over and I had no time to work on my website. But for the last few weeks I have been updating my site and I think I've got it to a point that I am happy with.

From now on I am going to try and make a blog post once a week, every Friday. In these posts I will cover what I learned in school that week, progress on my assignments, and progress on our term game.

Since school is not starting until September, I will be posting unrelated blog posts. I thought it would be a good idea to get into the habit of writing posts weekly and it gives me a good opportunity to practice my writing for next term. The schedule for my planned blog posts include:

* July 24 - Thank You Iwata-san
* July 31 - Throwback: Honey Badgers Don't Care
* August 7 - My Top 10 Video Games Part One (6 - 10)
* August 14 - Vacation Time
* August 21 - My Top 10 Video Games Part Two (2 - 5)
* August 28 - My Favourite Video Game of All Time
* September 4 - My Five Favourite Smash Bros Characters
* September 11 - Back to School

These posts are subject to change.

Thanks for checking out my blog, and I hope you stick around to read my upcoming blog posts!
