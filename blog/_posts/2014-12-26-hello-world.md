Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio. On this site you will find my portfolio of work including my games, software, and art that I have developed and created. In addition I will be keeping a blog that will track all of the topics and assignments that I will be completing in the BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) Video Games Development program.

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on Git Hub. I'd like to thank my friend Dan, who introduced me to Jekyll. I am using the [Poole](https://github.com/poole) website template, developed by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) as a base for my website. In addition, I used Joshua Lande's [blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) to help get me started.

I hope you will enjoy my blog posts and check out my portfolio.
