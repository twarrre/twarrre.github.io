Homeworld 3 was the second game that I worked on professionally for Blackbird Interactive. The project was in development for about 5 years.

The game was released in 2024 and was published by Gearbox Publishing. We will continue to support the game with new content and patches.

I was a senior programmer on the project. I started on the project very late into development and mostly helped ship the game and support it post-launch.

I worked on several bug fixes in different areas like presentation, gameplay, UI, and input.

Homeworld 3 is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840080/Homeworld_3/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/homeworld-3">Epic</a>.
