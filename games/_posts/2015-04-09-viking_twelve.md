This game is still under construction.

This game is currently being developed by a team of five for the second term of the BCIT Video Game Development program. The game is a local two player turn-based strategy game, designed for players to pass an iPad back and forth. Each team selects and places their units, all of which have a pool of action points that they use to move, attack, search asteroids, or use their special powers. In this game I handled the camera controls, parts of the render pipeline, unit placement, and both the programming and designing of some of the GUI and HUD elements.

###Developed With:
* Engine: Unity
* Programming Language: C#
* IDE: Visual Studio 2013
