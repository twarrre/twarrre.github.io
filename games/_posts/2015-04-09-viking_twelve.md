Annoyed that historians were so begrudging in acknowledging that they were the first foreigners to reach the Americas, the Vikings have been secretly improving their long ships to prove once and for all that they're the best explorers by sailing into outer space! But what they didn't expect was that the outer reaches of our solar system are teeming with Grayliens. The Grayliens, angry that their heads are too big to wear the Vikings' awesome hats, have sworn to eliminate these stylish interlopers from their domain.

This game is was developed by a team of five for the second term of the BCIT Video Game Development program. The game is a local two player turn-based strategy game, designed for players to pass an iPad back and forth. Each team selects and places their units, all of which have a pool of action points that they use to move, attack, search asteroids, or activate their special powers. In this game I handled the camera controls, parts of the render pipeline, unit placement, and both the programming and designing of some of the GUI and HUD elements.

### Developed With:
* Platform: iPad running iOS 8.1 and up
* Graphics API: OpenGL ES 2.0
* Programming Language: Objective-C, C, and C++
* IDE: Xcode 6
