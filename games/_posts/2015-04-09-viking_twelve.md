In the middle of a hunger crisis, you and your trusty farming satchel are the only hope for humanity. What do you do now? In Plant a Carrot, you solve world hunger one carrot at a time. As you plant carrots, world hunger goes down, but if plant an evil carrot you actually harm humanity. 

This game was developed by a team of four during the Vancouver Global Game Jam. The theme for the Game Jam was "What do you do now?". For this game, I handled programming the animations, the design of the world, as well as the placement of the carrots. The game can be viewed <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/plant-carrot">here</a> and played <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/other/plant-a-carrot/46324/">here</a>.
