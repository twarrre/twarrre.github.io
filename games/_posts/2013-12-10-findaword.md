Find a Word is a word search game that delivers you endless different word searches to play. Just enter a link to you favourite blog or website, and the app will go to that site's word cloud and populate your word search with words from that site. If the site updates frequently, you can have a seemingly endless amount of words to find!

This game was developed by a team of four for a client during the industry projects term at BCIT. I handled the transitions between views, general page layouts including the grid that the letters are placed in, the swipe control / swipe assist, and the word checking.
