You are the sidekick of the legendary Supman, protector of the universe. But one day, Supman's arch enemies attack both of you and capture Supman. They split him into parts that they hid all over the world. Luckily you were able to save one of his parts in your escape, however you lost all of your limbs in the process. Now it is up to you to become the hero and find Supman's parts in order to bring peace back to the universe. But how will you do this without any limbs? Fortunately, you can borrow some limbs from the local wildlife!
