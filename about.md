<img id="aboutimg" src="/assets/icons/about.png" width="154" height="192" />My name's Trevor Ware and I am living in Richmond, British Columbia. I love playing video games and enjoy making them.

Ever since I was little, I've wanted to make video games, so I went to <a href="http://www.bcit.ca">BCIT</a> to learn programming. After four years I got my <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/825hbtech">Bachelors of Technology</a> from BCIT, specializing in Video Game Development. I am now working at <a href="http://blackbirdinteractive.com/">Blackbird Interactive</a> as a junior programmer. This site contains a portfolio of some of the games I have made over the years.
