This was my first attempt at learning 3D modelling, sculpting and texturing. I was taught by my friend who trained at Emily Carr University and the Think Tank Training Centre.

While making this art asset, I learned how to make a low-res base mesh, how to sculpt high-res details onto the mesh, how to add UV coordinates, how to bake normal and shadow maps, and create texture and specular maps. Rigging and animation was attempted, but never completed.

I found this experience to be very enjoyable, and plan to and have continued making more art assets for games I developed at BCIT.
